# vn-story-uploader

This is an API for creating, fetching and deleting scenes for my other project, _react-visual-novel_, with scenes created using another repo, _cli-vn-dialogue-maker_.

This API is written in Go using the gorilla/mux package, and connects to a MongoDB database.

The intent of this API is to learn how to create a basic API in Go, as well as how to use MongoDB.
